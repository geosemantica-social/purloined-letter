## 🧩 Overview
Empirical code for the *Semantic Density Experiment (v2.0, Oct 2025)* — measures multi-metric tensorial phase transitions in large language models (*Pythia 70M–410M*, scalable to ≥ 2.8B) as described in  
**“The Meaning — a Purloined Letter in Plain Sight.”**

This repository provides an open and reproducible implementation of the TdST-inspired framework for analyzing semantic-field phase transitions in LLMs.
