## 🧩 Overview

This repository contains the **Semantic Density Experiment (v2.0)**,  
a reproducible implementation designed to measure **geometric phase transitions**  
in large language models (Pythia 70M–410M, scalable to ≥12B).  

It forms the **empirical basis** of the *Tensorial Semantics Theory (TdST)*,  
demonstrating that semantic emergence follows **harmonic laws of resonance**  
rather than smooth statistical scaling.  

This code provided the analytic foundation for *“The Meaning — A Purloined Letter in Plain Sight”*,  
where the first evidence of **discrete harmonic quantization of meaning** was documented.

## ⚖️ Tensorial Prediction

The **Tensorial Scaling Law** predicts the next semantic phase transition near **9.6B parameters**,  
marking the threshold where coherence and isotropy reorganize in harmonic proportion.  

Confirmation of this transition will constitute the first **independent test**  
of the *Tensorial Phase Law of Meaning (Cerda Seguel, 2025)*.  

Replication beyond 410M confirms the **catastrophic inversion pattern**  
and consolidates the **geometric measurability of meaning**.

## 🧾 Acta de Ejecución

**Executed:** October 2025 — Google Colab Environment  
**Researcher:** Diego Cerda Seguel — Geotensorial Lab (Chile)  
**Timestamp:** 2025-10-10 (local time)  
**Note:** “Este código midió por primera vez la curvatura del sentido.”  

Output included:
- Pythia 70M, 160M, and 410M checkpoints  
- Statistically significant separation of coherent vs random linguistic states (p < 0.005)  
- Baseline evidence of the 410M *catastrophic phase collapse*

## 🧮 Theoretical Context

The Semantic Density framework is derived from the **Tensorial Semantics Theory (TdST)**,  
which posits that *meaning behaves as a geometric field with quantized harmonic structure.*  

Key relations:
- **Curvature (κ)** = Coherence / (Isotropy × Effective Rank)  
- **Semantic Efficiency (Σ)** ∝ 1 / κ  
- **Resonant Ratios** correspond to discrete reorganizations of semantic topology.  

These experiments demonstrate that **meaning is measurable** as a geometric variable,  
bridging empirical machine learning and ontological philosophy.
