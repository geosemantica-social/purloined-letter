## 🧩 Overview

Empirical implementation of the *Semantic Density Experiment (v2.0, Oct 2025)* —  
a multi-metric framework for detecting **tensorial phase transitions** in large language models (*Pythia 70M–410M*, scalable to ≥ 2.8B) as described in  
**“The Meaning — a Purloined Letter in Plain Sight.”**

This repository provides the reproducible baseline for the **Tensorial Theory of Meaning (TdST)**,  
measuring emergent semantic efficiency through representational geometry.

## ⚖️ Tensorial Prediction

The tensorial scaling law predicts the **next semantic phase transition near 9.6 B parameters**.  
Verification of this threshold in future checkpoints constitutes an **independent empirical test**  
of the *Tensorial Phase Law of Meaning* (Cerda Seguel, 2025).

Replication beyond 410 M confirms the inversion pattern’s stability  
and remains proprietary within the *Geosemántica Social* corpus.
